# Limit Order Book Event Stream Prediction with Diffusion Model (LOBDIF)

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper:

**"Limit Order Book Event Stream Prediction with Diffusion Model"**

## Overview

We propose a diffusion-based generative framework for modeling and predicting event streams in limit order book (LOB) systems. This approach captures both the irregular temporal dynamics and discrete event types effectively.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
